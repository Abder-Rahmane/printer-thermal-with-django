<p>Python ESC/POS is a library which lets the user have access to all those printers handled by ESC/POS commands, as defined by Epson, from a Python application.

The library tries to implement the functions provided by the ESC/POS-commandset and supports sending text, images, barcodes and qr-codes to the printer.

Text can be aligned/justified and fonts can be changed by size, type and weight.

Also, this module handles some hardware functionalities like cutting paper, control characters, printer reset and similar functions.

Since supported commands differ from printer to printer the software tries to automatically apply the right settings for the printer that you set. These settings are handled by escpos-printer-db which is also used in escpos-php.</p>
